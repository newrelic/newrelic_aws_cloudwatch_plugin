- Bundler `gem install bundler`
- Git

## Install

## AMI
This plugin is also available as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) via the AWS Marketplace. Learn more, then quickly install and configure the AMI here: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00DMMUO0O/

The AMI takes the contents of `config/newrelic_plugin.yml` as user-data, which is configured when creating the EC2 instance. Once the instance is running with valid user-data, no further action is required. To change the configuration, terminate the current instance and create another.

If you like the AMI, please leave a 5-star review in the AWS Marketplace.

If you don't like the AMI, New Relic would appreciate that you do not leave a bad review on the AWS Marketplace. Instead, open a ticket with New Relic Support (via the support link) and let us know what we could do better. We take your feedback very seriously and will work on improvements as soon as possible. Plus, by opening a ticket, we'll notify you when we've addressed your feedback.

## Notes

- CloudWatch detailed monitoring is recommended, please enable it when available. (see *Using Amazon CloudWatch* section on http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)
- Chart x-axis (time) is off by 60 seconds, this is due to CloudWatch's lag in reporting metrics.
- Latest data point is used to fill gaps in low resolution metrics.
- Can use services like Upstart, Systemd, Runit, and Monit to manage the process.
