# New Relic AWS

This tool provides the metric collection agents for the following New Relic plugins:

- EC2
- EBS
- ELB
- RDS
- SQS
- SNS
- ElastiCache

## Dependencies
- A single t1.micro EC2 instance (in any region)
- Ruby (>= 1.9.2)
- Rubygems (>= 1.3.7)
- Bundler `gem install bundler`
- Git

## Install
1. Download the latest tagged version from [https://github.com/newrelic-platform/newrelic_aws_cloudwatch_extension/tags](https://github.com/newrelic-platform/newrelic_aws_cloudwatch_extension/tags)
2. Extract to the location you want to run the plugin from
3. Rename `config/template_newrelic_plugin.yml` to `config/newrelic_plugin.yml`

## AMI
This plugin is also available as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) via the AWS Marketplace. Learn more, then quickly install and configure the AMI here: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00DMMUO0O/

The AMI takes the contents of `config/newrelic_plugin.yml` as user-data, which is configured when creating the EC2 instance. Once the instance is running with valid user-data, no further action is required. To change the configuration, terminate the current instance and create another.

If you like the AMI, please [leave a 5-star review](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/review/product-reviews/ref=dtl_pop_customer_reviews?ie=UTF8&asin=B00DMMUO0O) in the AWS Marketplace.

If you don't like the AMI, New Relic would appreciate that you do not leave a bad review on the AWS Marketplace. Instead, open a ticket with [New Relic Support](https://support.newrelic.com) and let us know what we could do better. We take your feedback very seriously - and by opening a ticket, we can notify you when we've addressed your feedback.

## Notes
- CloudWatch detailed monitoring is recommended, please enable it when available. (see *Using Amazon CloudWatch* section on http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)
- Chart x-axis (time) is off by 60 seconds, this is due to CloudWatch's lag in reporting metrics.
- Latest data point is used to fill gaps in low resolution metrics.
